#
# - Databases: Progres, MySQL, Redis, Mongo, Elasticsearch
# - Servers: Apache, Nginx
# - Fuck (https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck): Correct your previous command. Note
#   that this needs to be added to zsh or bash. See the project README.
# - Foreman & Forego:
# - Tor ():
# - git-extras (https://vimeo.com/45506445): Adds a shit ton of useful commands #   to git.
# - autoenv (https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv): this utility makes it
#   easy to apply environment variables to projects. I mostly use it for Go and
#   Node.js projects. For Ruby projects, I just use Foreman or Forego.
# - autojump (https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump): a faster way to navigate
#   your filesystem.
